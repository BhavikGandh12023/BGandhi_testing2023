 Its Maori names include Piwauwau, matuitui and Tuke. Outside New Zealand it is sometimes known as the rockwren to distinguish it from the unrelated rock wren of North America.
 </p><p>Rock wrens are widely but patchily distributed through alpine and sub-alpine areas of the South Island. They are most common within the Southern Alps from Fiordland, through South Westland, and Mt Aspiring and Mt Cook National Parks</p></div>
