 Tuwharetoa in 1887. This was 15 years after the world's first national park, Yellowstone was created in the united states.</p><p>National parks are places set aside to protect 
 natural landscapes and native plants and animals forever. They are really big - 10,000 hectares or more. Protection comes first but they are also places for people to enjoy. 
 Go visit some of them (just don't damage the), we also have underwater national parks - they are called marine reserves!</p></div>
